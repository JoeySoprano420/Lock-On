For the Lock-On language, the following file extensions can be proposed to align with its features and functionality:

	1.	.lok or .lockon - These extensions can be used for general Lock-On source code files, where the primary scripts and logic of the program are written.
	2.	.lmod - Used for module files, which hold reusable code or libraries that can be imported into other Lock-On programs.
	3.	.lokc or .lockonc - This extension could be used for compiled Lock-On code when Lock-On files are compiled into an intermediate or machine code representation by the Lock-On AOT compiler.
	4.	.loki or .lockoni - This could represent Lock-On interpreted code, where scripts are run using the Just-In-Time (JIT) interpreter.
	5.	.lokm - An extension for macro files, containing macros or preprocessor instructions to be used within Lock-On source code.

These extensions maintain clarity in file type while distinguishing different components of the Lock-On ecosystem.
